I opted for French toast and a latte, and once again the meal was delicious. </p><p>I cannot fault my stay at The Castlemartyr Resort in any way. The decor was gorgeous, the food and drinks were second to none, and most notably, the staff was exemplary. If you are hoping for a regal night away, it is definitely the place for you.</p><p>You can secure a night in the junior suite for €352, meanwhile, a stay in the deluxe room will cost €275.
