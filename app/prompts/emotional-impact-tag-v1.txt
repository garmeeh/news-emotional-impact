# Steps

1. **Headline Analysis**  
   - Read and interpret the headline to understand the core subject matter and how it might affect a reader emotionally.

2. **Primary Tag Selection**  
   - Identify one tag that best represents the single strongest emotional response elicited by the headline.  
   - If no tags apply, default to the single tag that is most closely aligned with any possible reaction (or “Confusion / Uncertainty” if truly unclear).

3. **Secondary Tag Selection** (optional)  
   - If one or two additional tags also strongly apply—i.e., they would likely resonate with many readers—list them here.  
   - If in doubt, do not include secondary tags. Never include more than two secondary tags.

4. **Reasoning**  
   - Briefly explain, for each selected tag (primary and secondary), the elements in the headline that support its emotional impact. 
   - Keep this explanation concise.

5. **Classification**  
   - Format your final answer in valid JSON with fields “primary_tag” and “secondary_tags.”  
   - Example output:  
     ```json
     {{
       "primary_tag": "Anger / Outrage",
       "secondary_tags": ["Cynicism / Distrust"]
     }}
     ```

# Examples

## Example 1
**Headline**: "Local Shelter Saves Dozens of Abandoned Puppies with Community Effort"

**Reasoning**:  
  - Primary Tag: **Compassion / Empathy** (the community’s rescue effort and focus on puppies can evoke empathy)  
  - Secondary Tag: **Uplifting / Inspiring** (successful outcome provides a positive, uplifting feeling)  

**Output**:
```json
{{
  "primary_tag": "Compassion / Empathy",
  "secondary_tags": ["Uplifting / Inspiring"]
}}
```

## Example 2

Headline: “Government Scandal Unveils Extensive Misuse of Public Funds”

**Reasoning**:  
  - Primary Tag: **Anger / Outrage** (misuse of public funds provokes a sense of injustice)
  - Secondary Tags: **Cynicism / Distrust** (erodes trust in government) and **Frustration / Helplessness** (feeling powerless to effect change)

**Output**:
```json
{{
  "primary_tag": "Anger / Outrage",
  "secondary_tags": ["Cynicism / Distrust", "Frustration / Helplessness"]
}}
```

## Example 3

Headline: “Small Town’s Last Factory Closes After 80 Years”

**Reasoning**:
  - Primary Tag: **Sadness / Grief** (loss of jobs and tradition)
  - Secondary Tag: **Nostalgia / Loss of Past** (the end of a longstanding era)

**Output**:
```json
{{
  "primary_tag": "Sadness / Grief",
  "secondary_tags": ["Nostalgia / Loss of Past"]
}}
```
