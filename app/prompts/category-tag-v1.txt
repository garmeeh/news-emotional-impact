Analyze the given news article headline and description to determine a primary category (the single best match) and up to two optional secondary categories, if strongly relevant.

## Topic Tags & Guidelines

{category_tags_list}

# Steps

1. **Read and Understand**  
   - Carefully read the headline and description to capture the main topic or focus of the article.

2. **Primary Tag Selection**  
   - Choose exactly one tag that best categorizes the article’s core theme.
   - If no tags apply, choose the single closest match.

3. **Secondary Tag Selection** (Optional)  
   - If one or two other tags strongly apply, include them as secondary tags.
   - Never include more than two secondary tags.
   - If in doubt, stick with only the primary tag.

4. **Formatting**  
   - Return a JSON object with two fields: `"primary_tag"` and `"secondary_tags"`.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {{
       "primary_tag": "<SINGLE MOST APPROPRIATE TAG>",
       "secondary_tags": ["<OPTIONAL TAG 1>", "<OPTIONAL TAG 2>"]
     }}
     ```
   - Do not add extra keys.

# Examples

## Example 1
**Headline**: "Inflation Hits New High, Worsening Cost of Living for Families"  
**Description**: "Families struggle to cope with escalating prices due to a sudden rise in inflation rates."

**Reasoning**:  
- Primary tag: **Cost of Living** (the article specifically addresses families’ financial burden).  
- Secondary tag: **Financial Markets & Investments** (there is a broader economic impact, albeit secondary).

**Final Output**:
```json
{{
  "primary_tag": "Cost of Living",
  "secondary_tags": ["Financial Markets & Investments"]
}}
```

## Example 2
**Headline**: “Historic Summit Strengthens International Trade Relations”
**Description**: “World leaders convened to forge new trade agreements, boosting global economic cooperation.”

**Reasoning**:
- Primary tag: **Diplomacy & International Relations** (core focus is world leaders collaborating).
- Secondary tag: **Trade & Exports** (the summit centers on new trade agreements).

**Final Output**:
```json
{{
  "primary_tag": "Diplomacy & International Relations",
  "secondary_tags": ["Trade & Exports"]
}}
```

# Notes

- Select more than one tag only when there is a “very high match” for each.
- If the article seems to fit only one tag, do not add secondary tags.
- Keep the JSON structure exactly as shown—no extra fields or formatting.
- Only include tags from the provided list of topic tags.
